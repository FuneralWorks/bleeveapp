I would give me a 7 out of 10 for the product and a 5 out of 10 on my process. I would have liked to track my time better.
The hard parts were:
    -communicating with the API
    -trying to make it persistent but I'm not really good in backend

Surprising things:
    -I spend a lot of time planning out instead of coding which explains lack of commit.

I would take more time to think about the problems and plan out more efficiently.
